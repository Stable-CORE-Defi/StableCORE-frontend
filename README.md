# StableCORE

**StableCORE** â€“ A credibly-secure, Core-native stablecoin engine built for capital efficiency, modular yield, and on-chain transparency.

---

## Vision & Architecture Overview

### 1. Vision Statement

StableCORE is a Core-native, credibly secure, and fully collateralized stablecoin designed to become the foundational stable asset within the Core blockchain ecosystem. It provides a trust-minimized, yield-optional, and composable dollar-denominated tokenâ€”built for users, protocols, and institutions seeking transparent financial primitives on Core.

By leveraging Coreâ€™s hybrid consensus and Bitcoin-derived security guarantees, StableCORE is optimized for scalability, decentralization, and integration into the next generation of on-chain finance.

### 2. Design Principles

| Principle           | Description                                                                                                   |
|---------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Credibly Secure** | All reserves and mechanics are governed by transparent, deterministic smart contracts. No user funds are exposed to discretionary risks or black-box financial behavior. |
| **Fully Collateralized** | Every StableCORE token is backed 1:1 by on-chain reserve assets, including Core-native USDC/USDT and lstBTC. |
| **Yield-Optional**  | Users may opt into yield-bearing strategies backed by performance-guaranteed agents, without impacting the peg or solvency of the base stablecoin. |
| **Trust-Minimized Guarantees** | A slashing-based model ensures that operational failures are absorbed by collateral providers, not end-users. This eliminates governance subjectivity and ensures objective enforcement. |
| **Composable & Modular** | Designed to integrate seamlessly with Core DeFi: AMMs, lending markets, derivatives, and staking ecosystems. |

### 3. Architecture & Workflow

#### 3.1 Base Stablecoin Layer
- **Minting:** Users deposit reserve assets (e.g., USDC, USDT, lstBTC) into the StableCORE vault contract to mint StableCORE tokens 1:1.
- **Redemption:** At any time, users may burn StableCORE to retrieve the equivalent amount of reserve tokens.
- **Reserves:** All reserves are held transparently in Core-native contractsâ€”auditable, non-custodial, and overcollateralized if needed.

#### 3.2 Optional Yield Layer
- Users may stake StableCORE into structured yield vaults, operated by agents who deploy capital into whitelisted strategies (e.g., MEV capture, LST arbitrage, RWA yield).
- These operators must be guaranteed by restakers, who post collateral to underwrite operator performance.
- In case of underperformance or failure, smart contracts automatically slash restaker collateral to make users whole.

#### 3.3 Slashing & Enforcement Mechanism
- Smart contracts enforce strict risk thresholds and performance metrics.
- Any deviation from pre-defined strategy results in slashing.
- No human intervention required; enforcement is fully deterministic and rules-based.

### 4. Governance & Evolution

- **Phase 1:** Launch with controlled governance via multisig of CoreDAO-aligned members.
- **Phase 2:** Transition to on-chain, community-driven DAO governance.

**Governance Powers:**
- Adjust reserve ratios
- Whitelist strategy types
- Update agent/restaker requirements
- Manage fee structures

### 5. Ecosystem Integration

- **Stable Asset for Core DeFi:** StableCORE will power Core-native liquidity pools, lending protocols, derivatives, and payment rails.
- **Yield Primitive:** Yield-bearing versions of StableCORE can serve as collateral, funding instruments, or revenue-bearing assets.
- **Composable Guarantees:** Restakers and operators can be modular components plugged into existing Core protocol infrastructure.

### 6. Roadmap

| Phase      | Objectives                                                                                       |
|------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Q3 2025** | Launch MVP of StableCORE with stable reserve backing (USDC/USDT). Deploy base mint/redeem contracts on Core Mainnet. |
| **Q4 2025** | Integrate lstBTC as collateral. Launch slashing mechanism and yield-optional vaults. Begin restaker onboarding. |
| **Q1 2026** | Enable DAO governance. Open up new operator classes and deploy composable yield infrastructure. |
| **Q2 2026+** | Expand cross-chain access, deploy HTLC-based atomic swaps, and integrate further Core-native financial protocols. |

### 8. Strategic Value

- **Network-Optimized:** StableCORE is purpose-built for Coreâ€™s architecture, enabling fast, low-cost transactions and seamless DeFi composability.
- **Security Inheritance from Bitcoin:** As a Core-native application, StableCORE benefits from Coreâ€™s Satoshi Plus consensus and indirect Bitcoin security.
- **Decentralized Risk Management:** Users are never exposed to the performance risk of operators. Restakers serve as decentralized insurers, creating a robust financial firewall.
- **Economic Multiplicity:** By splitting stablecoin utility and yield into separate layers, StableCORE supports diverse user profilesâ€”risk-averse holders and yield-seeking stakers alike.

## ðŸ”„ Future Vision

Over time, StableCORE will evolve into a full-scale operator and financial coordination layer, integrating Core-native protocols, liquid staking tokens (LSTs), and decentralized strategy networks into a single, composable stablecoin engine.
